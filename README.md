# The Luca Bazooka

##Summary
This is a project started in the Robotics-Mechatronics class at Nueva High School. In order to support LBPH Histograms, OpenCV3 with opencv-contrib or OpenCV2 is required along with imageio and (optionally) skimage for additional visualization.

##Files 'n Stuff
pi-recognize.py: Code made to run on the Raspberry Pi that detects faces inputed into the training folder \\
pi-detect.py: Detects any sort of face using Haar Cascades (cascade data pulled from opencv) \\
testable-recognize.py: Nearly identical code to pi-recognize but configured so it can be run on a computer \\
servo.py: Contains the servo class used to point the pointer at a given coordinate. Used exclusively with the pi python code
